# Interview Booking System

The Interview Booking System is a decentralized application built on the Aptos Blockchain. It provides functionalities to view interview schedules, book interviews, and cancel interviews. To use the system, users need to input the interviewee's address, interviewer's address, and interview time. This README provides a detailed guide on how to use and navigate the system.

## Features

- **View Interview Schedule**: Users can access the system to view the unavailable interview slots and related information.
- **Book Interviews**: Users can reserve an interview slot by providing the interviewee's address, interviewer's address, and preferred interview time.
- **Cancel Interviews**: Users can cancel a previously booked interview by providing the interview code.
